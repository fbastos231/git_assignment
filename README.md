Issue is an item such as a task, a bug or a new feature that could be important to a software project to track using the issues tool in github.

1. In the main page of the repo navegate to "Pull requests" tab

e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is an open source distributed version control system that enables tracking of modifications of files. It is widely used by the software development community. GitHub is an online platform that hosts Git repositories and provides a wide variety of features built upon Git such as project management and continous integration tools.

f. What does git diff do?

git diff is a git command that shows a quick preview of changes made within a branch since the last commit. 

g. What is the main branch?

The main branch is the original branch created when a repository is created. Best practice is the have the main branch contain all the latest/desired changes for "production".    

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

I believe best practice is to create different branches to work on new changes. Therefore, no changes should not be pushed directly into the main branch.
